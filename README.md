# Story

At an unnamed bus stop each morning, Mira waited with cold coffee and warmer regrets, until one day a bus arrived early, driven by a man who looked exactly like her long-dead father, who told her it was the end of the line and showed her a road shimmering with her own memories—childhood, anger, loss—offering arrival without explanation; Mira chose instead to stay, reading a faded timetable that whispered _Don’t Be Afraid_, and as the bus departed and the world returned to normal, she walked to work feeling, quietly and unexpectedly, that she had arrived anyway.

She folded the timetable and slipped it into her coat pocket, unsure why she wanted to keep something that felt less like paper than permission. The morning moved on—vendors shouting, brakes sighing, the sky lifting its grey veil—but Mira carried a steadiness she hadn’t known before, as if the waiting itself had finally taught her how to stand. When she reached her office door, the coffee long gone cold in her hand, she paused, breathed once, and understood that some journeys end not with answers, but with the courage to continue asking.

Inside, the office smelled of toner and yesterday’s rain, a neutral place that usually asked nothing of her except attendance. Mira set the empty cup beside the sink and watched a thin ring of coffee stain the porcelain, a small, imperfect circle. She thought of the road the bus had shown her—how it shimmered without direction, how it asked her to step forward without telling her where she would land.

At her desk, the computer hummed awake. Emails bloomed across the screen, ordinary and insistent. For once, they did not feel like demands. They felt like coordinates—not destinations, just points she could choose to move between. Mira opened the first message and answered it slowly, deliberately, as if each word were a footfall.

Around midday, she felt the timetable in her pocket and unfolded it under the desk. The ink had faded further, or perhaps it had never been ink at all. The words *Don’t Be Afraid* were still there, but softer now, as if they trusted her to remember them without being told. She folded the paper again, smaller this time, and tucked it back where her hand could find it.

When evening came, she left the office and walked past the bus stop without pausing. The bench was empty, the timetable box freshly replaced, its glass clear and silent. Mira smiled at it—not with gratitude, exactly, but recognition. Some lessons, she realized, did not need repeating.

At home, she opened the window and let the city’s distant breathing fill the room. Tomorrow morning would come with its own waiting, its own arrivals and departures. She did not know what she would choose then. But as the light faded and the day settled into itself, Mira felt no urgency to know. The road was still there, somewhere. So was the bus. And for the first time, she understood that neither would leave without her.
